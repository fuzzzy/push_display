PUSH DISPLAY
============

This draft demo application shows video from camera on Ableton Push 8x8 pads.
Ableton Push pads has 127 fixed colors, so to achieve "realistic" color reproduction application builds mapping from RGB colorspace to Ableton Push's 127 colors.

Application requires Processing 2 and the MidiBus MIDI library to run. You need a webcam also. There is no automatic midi port detection for push, so may be you'll need to change this line: 
	pushMidiBus = new MidiBus(this, 2, 2);
with port numbers matching your configuration. Actually, only output port is needed. 

After start you'll see four 8x8 screens on the monitor with slightly different colors, and  some pictures on Push of course.
